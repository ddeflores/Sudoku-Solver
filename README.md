# Sudoku Solver and Visualization
This is a sudoku solver I made with Python and Flask for an Introductory AI course. You can input a puzzle of your choice, or choose a premade one!

## Getting Started
You can either clone the repository or download the programming_project_2.ipynb notebook.
The notebook has detailed instructions to get up and runnning with it.

Otherwise, you can also use the .py files directly. After cloning, simply:
- navigate to part 6,
- make sure you have Flask installed (double check the Python interpreter is the same version you installed Flask on)
- run the program
- click on the link that is output, and you're good to go!

## Note
To download Flask, run this command in the terminal:
```
pip install flask
```
