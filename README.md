# Sudoku Solver and Visualization
This is a sudoku solver I made with Python and Flask for an Introductory Artificial Intelligence course. You can input a puzzle of your choice, or choose a premade one to solve!

## Getting Started
Download sudoku.ipynb from this repository.
The notebook has detailed instructions to get up and runnning with it.

If you prefer, you can also use the .py files directly. After cloning, simply:
- navigate to server.py,
- make sure you have Flask installed (and double check the Python interpreter is the same version you installed Flask on)
- run the program
- click on the link that is output, and you're good to go!

## Note
To download Flask, run this command in the terminal:
```
pip install flask
```
